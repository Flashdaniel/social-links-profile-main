### What I learned

how to add footer to the bottom of the page

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<footer>
  <div class="attribution">
    Challenge by
    <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank"
      >Frontend Mentor</a
    >. Coded by <a href="#">Your Name Here</a>.
  </div>
</footer>
```

```css
@media (min-height: 45em) {
  footer {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 20px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Better ways to write clean code, place the footer to the bottom of the page and make my design more perfect.
